# COMP4332: Big Data Mining and Management

This repo contains the code used in the tutorials for the class. For each tutorial, ppt for further explanation of different tasks is provided, as well as the skeleton (`tut*_skeleton.py`) and the answer (`tut*_ans.py`). Both files should be the same as the skeleton code is already completed during the tutorial.

The code was run on top of Conda environment with nltk, Keras, sklearn, and tensorflow installed on Python3.6.

For sentiment analysis tasks, data used is based on [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge)
